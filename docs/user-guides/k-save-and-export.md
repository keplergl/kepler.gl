# Save and Export

![Save and Export](https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net/kepler.gl/documentation/k-save-and-export-1.png "activate interactions")

kepler.gl is a client-side only application. In the demo app, the data you uploaded stays in your browser. Uber doesn't send or store any user data to any backends. This rule poses an limitation on how you can save and share your maps.

However, in the demo app, you can:

- [Export map as an image](#export-image).
- [Export filtered or unfiltered data as a csv](#export-data).
- [Export current map configuration as a `json` file](#export-config), this file does not contain any map data.
- [Export current map configuration __AND__ map data as a `json` file](#export-config), which can be loaded back to kepler.gl to reproduce the current map.
- [Export current map to html file](#export-map-as-html)
- [Export current map to Dropbox](#export-dropbox), which can be used to share your maps with other users via permalink

You can export the current map as an image. The export window will use the current map viewport, and the preview will show the entire exported map area. To adjust the viewport, you will have to close the export dialog. You can choose different export ratios or resolutions, and also to add a map legend.

You can export map data as a csv file, with the option to export ONLY the filtered data or the entire dataset.

#### 1.Export Current Config

You can export the current map configuration as a `json` file. This is useful when you are running your own kepler.gl application and want to load data with a specific preset configuration. The map config includes the current layer, filter, map style and interaction settings.

**Note:** kepler.gl map config is coupled with loaded datasets. The __`dataId`__ key is used to bind layers, filters and tooltip settings to a specific dataset. If you try to upload a configuration with a dataset in your own kepler.gl app, you also need to make sure your dataset __`id`__ matches the __`dataId`__ in the config.

#### 2.Save and Export Current Map

To save and share your current map, click the __Export Current Map__ check box to export current configuration __AND__ uploaded data in a single `json` file.  **You can load this json file back to kepler.gl by simply drag and drop it in the __Add Data to Map__ dialog.**

## <a href="#export-map-as-html">Export Map as HTML</a>

![Export Map as HTML](https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net/kepler.gl/documentation/k-save-and-export-5.png "activate interactions")

To save and export your current map as HTML file, click on __Export Map__ and subsequently on __Export__. 
When prompted provide your own mapbox token to be used in the newly generated file. If you don't provide a Mapbox Token,
Kepler.gl will use a default one which can expire at anytime without any communication and therefore break your your existing map.

### How to update an exported map token
In order to edit the mapbox token in your html file you simply need to perform the following steps:
1. [Create a new mapbox token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/) or use your existing one.
2. Open the kepler.gl.map file with your favorite text editor.
3. Locate the following line in the exported file __kepler.gl.html__:
```javascript
  /**
   * Provide your MapBox Token
   **/
  const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'CURRENT_TOKEN';
```
4. Replace the current value a new valid token. The code should now look like the following:
```javascript
  /**
   * Provide your MapBox Token   
   **/
  const MAPBOX_TOKEN = 'pk.eyJ1IjoidWJlcmRh...';
```

## <a href="#export-dropbox">Export current Map as HTML</a>
![Export Map to Dropbox](https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net/kepler.gl/documentation/k-save-and-export-6.png "activate interactions")

To export the current map into your Dropbox account, click on __Save Map Url__ and select Dropbox as your cloud storage. 
Perform the authentication against Dropbox using your credentials. Once the authentication process is completed, 
click on __Upload__ and Kepler.gl will push your current map onto your account.

At the end of the process Kepler.gl will automatically generate a permalink for your work you can share with other users.
