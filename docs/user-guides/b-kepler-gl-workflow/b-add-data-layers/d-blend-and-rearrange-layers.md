# Blend and Rearrange Layers

 **Rearrange layers by dragging and dropping them in the Layers panel. The layers at the top of the list will be displayed in the foreground of the map.**

 **There are three different ways to blend layers: Normal, Additive, and Subtractive.**  
  


## Normal Blending

Normal layer blending does not alter the color values of overlapping data points. ![Normal blending](https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net/kepler.gl/documentation/image19.png)

## Additive Blending

Additive blending adds the color values for overlapping data points. It makes layers, and particularly areas of high density, easier to visualize on a dark-colored map. ![Additive blending](https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net/kepler.gl/documentation/image34.png)

## Subtractive Blending

Subtractive layer blending does not alter the color values of overlapping data points. ![Subtractive blending](https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net/kepler.gl/documentation/image26.png)
