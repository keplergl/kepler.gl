Arc layers draw an arc between two points. They’re useful for visualizing the distance between two points as well as comparing distances in 3D. Note that arc layers don’t show routes between points, but simply the distance between the two points. The tallest arc represents the greatest distance.

To draw arcs, your dataset must contain the latitude and longitude of two different points for each arc.
