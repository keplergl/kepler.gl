## Overview

Kepler.gl is a __Redux-connected__ component. You can embed kepler.gl in your App, which uses redux to manage its state. The basic implementation of kepler.gl reducer is simple. However, to make the most of it, it's recommended to have basic knowledge on:

- [React][react]
- [Redux][redux] state container
- [React Redux connect][react-redux]

To start out with kepler.gl, you simply need to add the Kepler.gl UI component and mount the Kepler.gl reducer. To give the user full access of all the functionalities of kepler.gl, this package also includes actions, schema managers and a set of utilities to load and save map data.
