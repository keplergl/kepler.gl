# Basic Mapping

Original GeoDa lab by Luc Anselin: https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/3a_mapping/lab3a.html

## Introduction

In this Chapter, we will explore a range of mapping and geovisualization options. We start with a review of common thematic map classifications. We next focus on different statistical maps, in particular maps that are designed to highight extreme values or outliers. We also illustrate maps for categorical variables (unique value maps), and their extension to multiple categories in the form of co-location maps. We close with a review of some special approaches to geovisualization, i.e., ~~conditional maps~~, the cartogram and map animation.

 The main objective is to use the maps to interact with the data as part of the exploration process.

## Preliminaries

We will illustrate the various operations by means of the data set with demographic and socio-economic information for 55 New York City sub-boroughs.
